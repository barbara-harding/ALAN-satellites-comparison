This study compares GIS-based artificial light at night (ALAN) satellite data from 3 satellite types- the DMSP-OLS, VIIRS and ISS. 
The DMSP-OLS and VIIRS data have traditionally been used most often in epidemiologic studies (particularly the DMSP-OLS), however these images have various limitations: low resolution (both DMSP-OLS and VIIRS), saturation (DMSP-OLS) and no information on spectrum of light.
Individuals can see relevant code for analyzing the risk between ALAN and colorectal cancer risk. They can also see an example of how to compare satellite-based data values (correlation, bland-altman plots).
