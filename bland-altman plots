Code is included to generate Bland- Altman plots with non-linear trend for bias (green solid line) including confidence intervals (grey shading) 
using generalized additive models to compare artificial light at night measurements for 
(a) visual light from the Defense Meteorological Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) 2011 versus visual light from the International Space Station (ISS, 2012 Madrid; 2013 Barcelona) and 
(b) visual light from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 2013 versus visual light from the ISS (2012 Madrid; 2013 Barcelona). 
The black dots represent data values for each participant. 
The limits of agreement (average difference Â± 1.96 standard deviation of the standardized difference) are shown by the red dashed lines in each of the figures. 
The limits of agreement for the DMSP-OLS versus ISS visual measurements was 2.90 (95%CI 2.80, 3.01), while for the VIIRS versus ISS visual it was 2.32 (2.24, 2.41).
